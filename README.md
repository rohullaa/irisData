# Iris data

In assignment we set up a pipeline for classifying data using **scikitlearn**. The main topic for this assignment is to practise the art of (reproducibility)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility]. The procedure started with choosing the iris dataset and an algorithm. We then generated data with the same characteristics as the iris and used the generated data to tune some of the hyperparameters of the algorithm. Lastly, we trained models using bootstrap replicates of the original dataset and report the accuracy on independent test sets.

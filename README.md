# Iris data

In assignment we set up a pipeline for classifying data using **scikitlearn**. At first we will pick a dataset and choose an algorithm. We then generate data with the same characteristics as the chosen dataset and use the generated data to tune some of the hyperparameters of the algorithm. Lastly, we train models using bootstrap replicates of our chosen dataset and report the accuracy on independent test sets.
